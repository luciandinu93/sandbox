 * Basic Data Types challange from HACKERRANK.COM
 * Input format: Input consists of following space-separated values: int, long, char, float, and double
 * Output format: Print each element on a new line in the same order as received from input.
 * Note that the floating point should be up to 3 decimals places and the double up to 9 decimal places.

 #include <ifstream> // input will be read from file
